# Regression Analysis: Predicting Aggregate Rating of Restaurants
### Introduction to the project
A regression model is a supervised learning model used to estimate a value based on some given features.
The dataset that was made use of consists of data gotten from multiple restaurant, which will be made use of to predict the Aggregate rating of a restaurant.

### Libraries Used
The following libraries were utilised in the process of carrying out this project:
* Pandas: Used to import the dataset to be worked with
* Numpy: Mathematical operations
* Matplotlib: Data Visulaization tool
* Plotly.express: Another data visualization tool, but more interactive.
* train_test_split: Scikit learn library used to split data into training and test sets.
* Machine Learning models: Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor
* sklearn.pipeline: Created a pipeline to iterate over each model.
* Sklearn.metrics: Used to evaluate the performance of the Regression models (Metrics used: Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error and R^2 score)
